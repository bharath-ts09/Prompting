Summarize the following paragraph in one sentence:

Antibiotics target specific features of bacterial cells that are not found in human cells, which helps to minimize damage to the host. Common mechanisms include:
- **Cell wall synthesis inhibition**: Antibiotics like penicillin prevent bacteria from forming their protective cell walls, leading to cell lysis.
- **Protein synthesis inhibition**: Some antibiotics target the ribosomes of bacteria, disrupting their ability to produce proteins essential for growth and function.
- **Nucleic acid synthesis inhibition**: Certain antibiotics interfere with the processes that allow bacteria to replicate their DNA and RNA.
- **Metabolic pathway interference**: Some antibiotics disrupt pathways that bacteria use to synthesize essential nutrients.



**Response**
Antibiotics work by targeting unique bacterial structures and processes, such as cell wall formation, protein synthesis, DNA/RNA replication, and essential metabolic pathways, minimizing harm to human cells.



****Explanation****

**Prompt**
Explain Zero shot prompting as you are explaining to a 10 year old


**Response**
Okay, imagine you’re asking me a question about something I’ve never been told before, like, “What’s the capital of Mars?” Even though I’ve never been taught about Mars’ capital, I try my best to guess the answer using what I already know. That’s kind of like zero-shot prompting — when you ask me to do something without giving me any examples first, and I figure it out based on what I’ve learned!
