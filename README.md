****Summarization****
-----------------------


**Objective**
Summarize the following paragraph in one sentence

**Prompt**
Summarize the following paragraph in one sentence:

Antibiotics target specific features of bacterial cells that are not found in human cells, which helps to minimize damage to the host. Common mechanisms include:
- **Cell wall synthesis inhibition**: Antibiotics like penicillin prevent bacteria from forming their protective cell walls, leading to cell lysis.
- **Protein synthesis inhibition**: Some antibiotics target the ribosomes of bacteria, disrupting their ability to produce proteins essential for growth and function.
- **Nucleic acid synthesis inhibition**: Certain antibiotics interfere with the processes that allow bacteria to replicate their DNA and RNA.
- **Metabolic pathway interference**: Some antibiotics disrupt pathways that bacteria use to synthesize essential nutrients.



**Response**
Antibiotics work by targeting unique bacterial structures and processes, such as cell wall formation, protein synthesis, DNA/RNA replication, and essential metabolic pathways, minimizing harm to human cells.



****Explanation****
--------------------


**Objective**
Explain Zero shot prompting to a small kid

**Prompt**
Explain Zero shot prompting as you are explaining to a 10 year old


**Response**
Okay, imagine you‚Äôre asking me a question about something I‚Äôve never been told before, like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the capital of Mars?‚Äù Even though I‚Äôve never been taught about Mars‚Äô capital, I try my best to guess the answer using what I already know. That‚Äôs kind of like zero-shot prompting ‚Äî when you ask me to do something without giving me any examples first, and I figure it out based on what I‚Äôve learned!

********Chain of Thought Prompting********
-------------------------------------------

****Few Shot Chain of thought****

**Objective**

With an example provided perform multi step calculations

**Prompt**

Q: If there are 5 Bananas, 2 Apple with Raju. Raju ate 2 banana and 1 apple. He later bought 3 Pear. How many fruits does he have in the end
A: Raju starts with 5 Bananas and 2 apples, total 7 fruits. He eats 2 bananas and 1 apple, he now has 3 bananas and 1 apple. He buys 3 pears, adding those 3 bananas + 1 apple + 3 pears = 7 fruits
Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, Half an hour later 1 car leave. How many cars are remaining in the parking lot?
A:

**Response**

A: There are initially 3 cars in the parking lot. üöóüöóüöó

2 more cars arrive ‚Üí Now there are 5 cars. üöóüöóüöóüöóüöó

1 car leaves after half an hour ‚Üí 5 - 1 = 4 cars remaining. ‚úÖ

-------------------------------------------------------------

****Zero Shot Chain of thought****

**Objective**

Perform Zero shot Chain of thought using "Lets think step by step"

**Prompt**

Q: If there are 5 Bananas, 2 Apple with Raju. Raju ate 2 banana and 1 apple. He later bought 3 Pear. How many fruits does he have in the end
Lets think step by step 

**Response**

Sure! Let‚Äôs think step by step:

Starting fruits:

üçå 5 Bananas + üçé 2 Apples = 7 fruits

Raju eats:

2 Bananas ‚Üí 5 - 2 = 3 Bananas left

1 Apple ‚Üí 2 - 1 = 1 Apple left

Fruits remaining after eating:

3 Bananas + 1 Apple = 4 fruits

Raju buys 3 Pears: üçêüçêüçê

4 fruits + 3 Pears = 7 fruits

‚úÖ Final count: 3 Bananas, 1 Apple, and 3 Pears = 7 fruits.

****Auto-COT****

Auto-CoT consists of two main stages:

Stage 1): question clustering: partition questions of a given dataset into a few clusters
Stage 2): demonstration sampling: select a representative question from each cluster and generate its reasoning chain using Zero-Shot-CoT with simple heuristics

Code for Auto-COT is here below
