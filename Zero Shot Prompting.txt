Summarize the following paragraph in one sentence:

Antibiotics target specific features of bacterial cells that are not found in human cells, which helps to minimize damage to the host. Common mechanisms include:

- **Cell wall synthesis inhibition**: Antibiotics like penicillin prevent bacteria from forming their protective cell walls, leading to cell lysis.
- **Protein synthesis inhibition**: Some antibiotics target the ribosomes of bacteria, disrupting their ability to produce proteins essential for growth and function.
- **Nucleic acid synthesis inhibition**: Certain antibiotics interfere with the processes that allow bacteria to replicate their DNA and RNA.
- **Metabolic pathway interference**: Some antibiotics disrupt pathways that bacteria use to synthesize essential nutrients.
